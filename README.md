# YOLO-Object-Detection-with-TensorFlow-and-OpenCV
A real-time object detection system implemented using YOLO (You Only Look Once) architecture with TensorFlow and OpenCV. This project provides capabilities for detecting and classifying objects in both images and video streams, with specific focus on detecting raccoons, horses, dogs, and cats.
